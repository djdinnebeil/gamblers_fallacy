# Craps and the Gambler’s Fallacy
## Purpose
This project demonstrates the Gambler’s Fallacy using the game of Craps.

## What is the Gambler’s Fallacy?
The Gambler’s Fallacy is the mistaken belief that past independent events influence future outcomes in a random process. In other words, if an event has occurred more frequently than expected in the past, one might wrongly assume it is "due" to happen less often in the future—or vice versa.

### Example
In Craps, a player might believe that because they have lost several rounds in a row, they are now "due" for a win. However, each roll of the dice is independent, meaning previous rolls do not affect future ones. The odds remain the same regardless of past outcomes.
